Back-end
Simplify - Productivity Web App

January 6th


Hey GLs and group members, I've prepared this document for the backend, given the recent complications and changes we've experienced over the past week. This document serves as a foundation for understanding the expected functionalities of the backend. I have conducted a little bit of research on the topic, as I wasn't initially familiar with. Thus I've formulated a few ideas on how we could approach the backend.

Upon reviewing these options, I would appreciate your feedback on which approach you believe would be the most suitable.


Option 1
Integrating Backend with Frontend
This would involve learning to use the framework called “Flask”. Using Flask we can connect the front end with the backend. Flask is a framework in python, we can use this to connect with HTML/CSS. For example we could have a login page that works and much more. 

Important considerations:
Allocate 2-3 hours for learning the framework through YouTube videos.
Install the Flask framework.
Actively collaborate with the frontend team.

Advantages:
-> I we can do this it would be sick
-> Provides a foundation for project expansion.

Disadvantages:
-> Time consuming
-> Broad scope.
-> Steeper learning curve.


Option 2
Developing Backend Separately
This basically means that Backen python would be coding the functions of the front end like, login, create account, etc.

Advantage:
-> More manageable scope.

Disadvantage:
-> Potential for insufficient workload.
-> Not as cool as option 1
-> Limited potential for project expansion.




Options 3 (NOT MANAGEABLE) just to give you guys an idea 
In practicality, an actual functioning Website would require a proper full stack development. If we wanted to make a website with python.
Backend -> Python frameworks (Django, Flask, and Pyramid)
Frontend ->JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue.js, or Angular)


Implementation:
Django for backend with APIs and databases.
React for frontend with interface design and routing.

Deployment:
Backend on platforms like Heroku or AWS (Amazon Web Services).
Frontend on platforms like Netlify or Vercel.

[Appropriate costs associated with the use of these platforms]
However, with our time constraints and lack of experience, this option is not viable for now.
